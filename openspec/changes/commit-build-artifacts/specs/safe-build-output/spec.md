## ADDED Requirements

### Requirement: Manifest file tracks promptkit-managed files
Each builder SHALL write a `.promptkit-managed` file in the output directory listing all generated file paths (relative to the output directory), one per line, sorted alphabetically, with a comment header.

#### Scenario: Manifest written after build
- **WHEN** a builder generates artifacts for 3 prompts
- **THEN** a `.promptkit-managed` file is created in the output directory
- **AND** it contains exactly 3 relative file paths, sorted alphabetically
- **AND** the first line is a comment: `# Generated by promptkit — do not edit`

#### Scenario: Manifest overwrites previous manifest
- **WHEN** a builder runs and a `.promptkit-managed` file already exists
- **THEN** the manifest is overwritten with the current build's file list

### Requirement: Builder removes only previously managed files
Before writing new artifacts, each builder SHALL read the existing `.promptkit-managed` file and remove only the files listed in it. Files not listed in the manifest SHALL NOT be touched.

#### Scenario: Stale managed files are removed
- **WHEN** the previous manifest lists `rules/old-rule.md`
- **AND** the new build does not generate `rules/old-rule.md`
- **THEN** `rules/old-rule.md` is deleted from the output directory

#### Scenario: Non-managed files are preserved
- **WHEN** the output directory contains `settings.json` (not in manifest)
- **AND** the builder runs
- **THEN** `settings.json` is still present after the build

#### Scenario: Non-managed files in category subdirectories are preserved
- **WHEN** the output directory contains `skills/openspec-apply/SKILL.md` (not in manifest)
- **AND** the builder generates `skills/my-skill.md`
- **THEN** both `skills/openspec-apply/SKILL.md` and `skills/my-skill.md` exist after build

### Requirement: Builder cleans empty directories after file removal
After removing previously managed files, the builder SHALL remove any category directories that are now empty. Directories that still contain files (managed or not) SHALL NOT be removed.

#### Scenario: Empty directory removed
- **WHEN** the only file in `agents/` was a managed file that was removed
- **AND** no new files are written to `agents/`
- **THEN** the `agents/` directory is removed

#### Scenario: Non-empty directory preserved
- **WHEN** `skills/` contains both a managed file (removed) and a non-managed file
- **THEN** the `skills/` directory is preserved

### Requirement: Missing manifest results in additive-only build
When `.promptkit-managed` does not exist, the builder SHALL skip cleanup and only write new artifacts. No existing files SHALL be removed.

#### Scenario: First build on existing directory
- **WHEN** the output directory exists but has no `.promptkit-managed` file
- **AND** the output directory contains existing files
- **THEN** the builder writes new artifacts without removing any existing files
- **AND** a `.promptkit-managed` file is created listing the newly generated files

#### Scenario: First build on empty directory
- **WHEN** the output directory does not exist
- **THEN** the builder creates the directory, writes artifacts, and creates `.promptkit-managed`
